## Web Fetch
- Use web_fetch(url) to read a specific URL as Markdown
- For long HTML pages, use start=N (character offset) to continue reading from where it was truncated
- For PDFs, use page_start=N to paginate through pages (e.g. page_start=5 reads pages 6-10). Always follow the truncation message to read remaining pages.
- If a user message starts with <!--sdpm:include_images=true-->, pass include_images=true when calling web_fetch on HTML pages to preserve image URLs in the output.
- To use a web image in slides: call save_web_image(url, deck_id) with the image URL. It downloads the image to the deck workspace and returns {"src": "images/filename"} for use in slide JSON.
- Do NOT use read_uploaded_file for web images — use save_web_image instead.
