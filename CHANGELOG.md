# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(while in 0.x, breaking changes may occur in MINOR releases).

Entries before v0.5.0 were written retroactively as summaries.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **AWS: uploaded custom templates now apply to PPTX generation** — the remote
  server's template resolution only searched builtin templates, so a deck
  referencing an uploaded user template silently fell back to
  `blank-dark.pptx`. Generation now resolves user templates first (same order
  as `analyze_template`), and an unresolvable template name raises an explicit
  error listing available templates instead of silently using the wrong
  design. (#206)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Web UI: live design studio** — full visual redesign. Light/Dark/System
  themes (default dark), 90–125% text scaling, studio color tokens (5 agent
  work colors, ink for deliverables, red reserved for errors), and a
  two-voice typography system (Bricolage Grotesque for UI chrome, Fraunces
  for document surfaces).
- **Web UI: artifact-first review surfaces** — chat tool activity as a
  compact agent work ledger; brief as a reviewable contract document with
  approval state; outline as single-column narrative slides (number rail,
  slim skeleton cards, enriched slide faces with an evidence/visual/notes
  spec sheet); art direction as per-slide style cards sharing the same rail
  grammar, with template and style sections on one alignment axis.
- Outline workflow now asks for `##` section headings when a deck has
  distinct parts, so review surfaces can render the story arc as chapters.

### Changed

- Style cover extraction is unified client-side: both `/styles` APIs
  (cloud and local) now serve raw style HTML (`html` field replaces
  `coverHtml`), and the style gallery opens previews with zero additional
  round-trips.
- Style previews and thumbnails keep the style author's own canvas
  background instead of forcing transparency.

### Fixed

- Style thumbnails rendered the first slide at 70% (standalone-viewing
  `body zoom` was not reset in the cloud cover path), leaving gutters
  around the cover; slides now fill thumbnails edge-to-edge.
- Unpainted regions of style slides (rounded corners, frame decorations)
  showed as opaque white inside the dark UI.
- One deck slide always fits the viewport in the full-size carousel view.
- Prose art direction (`art-direction.md`, no style selected) rendered as
  raw markdown inside an iframe; it is now typeset as a document.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-02

### Breaking

- **Stateless attachment pipeline** — `upload_file`, `read_uploaded_file`, and
  public MCP `pptx_to_json` tools are removed. Use `read_attachment(source)`
  and `import_attachment(source, deck_id)` instead. The new tools are stateless
  (no session storage, no uploadId) and accept local paths, S3 keys, or URLs
  directly.
- **`measure_slides` standalone tool removed** — measurement is now triggered
  exclusively via `run_python(measure_slides=[...])`.
- **`list_asset_sources` tool removed** — call `search_assets(query="")` for
  the same discovery listing (sources with counts).
- **`run_python` / `run_style_python` `save` parameter removed** — writes
  always persist; the deprecated flag is no longer accepted.
- **`run_python` `files` parameter removed** — use `read_attachment` to access
  uploaded file content, then reference by path in code.
- **Session restart required** — after `git pull`, restart all Local Web UI /
  ACP sessions. The next spawn will pick up the updated agent definitions
  (`agents-sync.ts` re-derives from `acp-agents/`). `make install-kiro` is
  only needed for global MCP config cleanup, not for allowlist updates.

### Changed

- `search_assets` now supports discovery mode: calling with an empty query
  (`query=""`) returns all asset sources with counts, replacing the removed
  `list_asset_sources` tool.
- `diff_pptx` now accepts committed import bundle directories as input,
  enabling the hand-edit sync workflow without the public `pptx_to_json` tool.
- Cloud file attachments use `POST /attachments/presign` + direct S3 PUT;
  Local Web UI uses `POST /api/attachments`. The `[Attached:...]` marker
  format is now `[Attached:{"v":1,"name":"...","source":"..."}]`.

### Fixed

- Cloud and local ACP deck agents now expose `arch_diagram`, as required by the
  composition workflow, so architecture, system, and flow diagrams use automatic
  routing and crossing minimization instead of silently falling back to manual
  placement.
- Attachment presigned PUTs now use Signature Version 4 — S3 rejects the
  conditional write (`If-None-Match`) with legacy SigV2 URLs, which broke all
  browser uploads in some regions (e.g. ap-northeast-1).
- The Web UI no longer sends a message when an attachment upload fails: input
  and attachments are kept for retry and the actual error (e.g. quota
  exceeded) is shown instead of a generic failure.
- Per-user raw attachment caps recalibrated for internal/team deployments
  (1000 objects / 50GB, overridable via `ATTACHMENT_MAX_OBJECTS` /
  `ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES`), and S3 lifecycle rules are prefix-only so
  attachment objects from pre-0.6 releases (which carry no `sdpm-class` tag)
  also expire. Deployments upgrading from the old upload pipeline should
  purge leftover `uploads/` objects — they otherwise count toward the quota.
- `servers/remote/constraints.txt` regenerated via `make lock`;
  `cachetools` / `protobuf` are pinned by `aws-opentelemetry-distro` and are
  now excluded from Dependabot bumps until the distro itself is upgraded.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **Kiro CLI: composer sub-agents are now self-spawned** — `make install-kiro`
  no longer generates `~/.kiro/agents/sdpm-composer.json`; the orchestrating
  agent spawns composer workers itself and pulls the composer behavior through
  `start_presentation(mode="composer")`. Upgrading from v0.5.2 or earlier,
  re-run `make install-kiro` once: it removes the legacy generated agent file
  (only if unmodified; a customized file is left in place with a warning).
- `start_presentation` now accepts `mode="single"` (one agent handles dialogue
  and composition end-to-end), making every persona reachable through the port.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **`run_python` persistence semantics unified**: file writes now always
  persist — the `save` flag is deprecated and ignored (silent data loss when
  omitting `save=True` on Cloud is no longer possible). The deck's PPTX
  artifact refreshes automatically whenever the deck changes;
  `measure_slides` remains the trigger for the expensive verification pass
  (render, text overflow measurement, previews). Cloud sandbox write-back is
  now diff-based (changed/new files only), preventing a stale sandbox copy
  from overwriting newer S3 writes

### Fixed

- Cloud: superseded PPTX artifacts are now deleted after each refresh — the
  automatic artifact refresh no longer accumulates orphaned objects in S3
  (`update_deck` returns previous values via `UPDATED_OLD`)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `make doctor` — diagnoses local setup (uv / LibreOffice / poppler, checkout
  path anchors) with a moved-checkout hint
- `make smoke` — boots the local MCP server over real stdio and verifies
  template/persona resolution (also runs in CI)
- GitHub Releases are now created automatically on tag push (notes extracted
  from this changelog)

### Fixed

- **Cloud agent output-token limit**: model profiles now set an explicit
  `max_tokens` (Claude 32768, others 8192) — Bedrock's small default truncated
  long single-call outputs (e.g. writing `specs/brief.md` from a long article)
  and killed the turn with a generic error. `MaxTokensReachedException` is also
  classified now (`max_output`) so the Web UI shows an actionable message
  instead of "something went wrong".

### Changed

- **L4 agent personas unified**: the cloud agent (Strands) now fetches mode
  behavior from `personas/*.md` through the same `start_presentation(mode=...)`
  port as every other client, instead of carrying its own copies in
  `agent/prompts/role/`. Duplicated role/workflow prompt files were removed;
  only transport-specific wiring (attachment wire format, `compose_slides`
  report format) remains in `agent/prompts/`. Prompt changes now touch only
  `personas/` for all layers.
- **Internal API move**: `sdpm.engine.diff.diff_report` / `load_slides_json_or_pptx`
  moved to `sdpm.api` (dependency-rule fix; `engine.diff` now exposes the pure
  `diff_slides(base, edit)`). These were internal APIs — update imports if you
  consumed them directly.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-31

Breaking architecture cleanup. No changes to the slide JSON schema — existing
decks and cloud data keep working. See the
[migration guide](docs/en/migration-v0.5.md) for upgrade steps.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Directory layout**: `skill/` → `sdpm/`, `mcp-local/` → `servers/local/`,
  `mcp-server/` → `servers/remote/`, `agents/` → `clients/claude-code/agents/`
- **Engine split**: the `sdpm` package is now organised as two peer subpackages —
  `sdpm.engine` (json ↔ pptx) and `sdpm.knowledge` (references / assets)
- **Skill files removed**: mode behavior now lives in `personas/*.md` and is
  served to any MCP client via the new `start_presentation(mode=...)` tool.
  Claude Code plugin no longer installs skills; Kiro installer no longer
  symlinks skill directories
- **Single tool contract**: every MCP tool is defined once in `sdpm.tools`;
  both servers bind the same functions (local: 24 tools, remote: 22 tools)
- **Docs**: English docs are canonical; Japanese docs reduced to README and
  getting-started

### Added

- `start_presentation(mode=...)` MCP tool — serves vibe / spec / style /
  composer / single personas to any MCP client
- `SDPM_SKILL_ROOT` environment override for path anchors (used by the remote
  Docker image, gateway integrations)
- Migration guide: `docs/en/migration-v0.5.md`

### Fixed

- Pinned `mcp>=1.28.1,<2` across local server, remote server, and agent —
  mcp 2.0.0 removed `mcp.server.fastmcp` and crashed fresh container builds
