## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Nested styled-text notation no longer leaks raw tags onto slides** —
  agents sometimes emit `{{bold:{{#FF0000:X}}}}` instead of the canonical
  `{{bold,#FF0000:X}}`; the parser could not see through nesting and rendered
  the inner tag as literal text. A flatten pre-pass now normalizes nesting
  (any depth, partial nesting included) to the comma form, with inner
  attributes taking priority. Non-nested input is untouched. (#123)
- **Builtin template download works from the Web UI** — downloading blank-dark /
  blank-light did nothing: the download used a `fetch()`+blob path that requires
  CORS, and the builtin resource bucket has no CORS configuration (user templates
  live in a different bucket that has one). Downloads now use the same direct-link
  navigation as deck PPTX downloads (no CORS involved), the presigned URL carries
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`, and failures show an error toast instead of
  silently doing nothing. (#281)
- **`grid` tool returns actionable errors and supports `%` / `repeat()`** —
  unsupported CSS track syntax (`auto`, `minmax()`, previously also `%` and
  `repeat()`) crashed with an uncaught `ValueError` instead of an error message
  the agent can react to. `%` and `repeat(n, X)` are now supported, unsupported
  syntax returns `{"error": ...}` naming the offending token, and the supported
  subset is documented in the tool docstring and grid guide. (#282)
- **Live preview: icons relying on even-odd fill no longer render as solid
  boxes** — LibreOffice's SVG export declares `fill-rule="evenodd"` only on the
  root `<svg>`, which the per-component fragment split dropped, so multi-subpath
  line-art icons (many AWS resource icons) lost their cutouts and appeared as
  filled rectangles in the live preview (final PNGs were unaffected). Root
  inheritable attributes are now propagated onto each fragment. (#288)

- **Architecture diagram box auto-height now works on non-16:9 templates and
  with CJK text** — the engine used a fixed 16:9 pt-to-px ratio for text
  measurement, causing boxes to undersize on 4:3 and other aspect ratios, and
  did not account for fullwidth (CJK) character width. `analyze_template` now
  reports `ptPerPx` in `slide_size`, the agent records it in `deck.json`
  `slideSize`, and `arch_diagram` accepts a `pt_per_px` parameter for accurate
  calibration. (#285)
- **Remote MCP: `analyze_template` now includes `slide_size` in cached
  results** — the cached template analysis omitted the `slide_size` field, so
  subsequent calls returned an incomplete response and the agent could not
  populate `deck.json` `slideSize`. (#285)

- **Custom templates with non-16:9 slide sizes (4:3 etc.) now lay out correctly** —
  the engine's px coordinate system followed the template width but assumed a
  fixed height of 1080, so 4:3 decks left the bottom quarter of every slide
  empty, reported false out-of-bounds warnings, mismatched placeholder
  coordinates, mis-measured text overflow, and rendered cropped previews in the
  Web UI. The canvas is now derived from the template's real dimensions
  (1920 px wide, height following the aspect ratio — 4:3 becomes 1920×1440),
  and `analyze_template` / `deck.json` carry the canvas size so slide
  composition uses the full slide. Behaviour for 16:9 templates is unchanged.
  Known limitation: architecture diagram boxes with an omitted `box.height`
  can still under-estimate text height on non-16:9 templates — specify
  `box.height` explicitly. (#208)
- **Live slide preview: the first few slides now animate** — animation was
  suppressed for 3 seconds after the slides tab appeared, and because a new
  deck switches to that tab as soon as slides arrive, the first slides were
  always shown instantly. Suppression is now based on whether the slides
  already existed when the view mounted, instead of a timer.
- **Live slide preview: the PNG fallback now actually appears** — the error
  state was reset on every 1-second poll, so the fallback was unmounted before
  it could be seen; a failure to find the render container also marked the
  slide as permanently processed, leaving an empty black box. Slides with
  nothing to draw now fall back to the rendered PNG, and the fallback image
  retries expired signed URLs.

- **AWS: uploaded custom templates now apply to PPTX generation** — the remote
  server's template resolution only searched builtin templates, so a deck
  referencing an uploaded user template silently fell back to
  `blank-dark.pptx`. Generation now resolves user templates first (same order
  as `analyze_template`), and an unresolvable template name raises an explicit
  error listing available templates instead of silently using the wrong
  design. (#206)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Web UI: live design studio** — full visual redesign. Light/Dark/System
  themes (default dark), 90–125% text scaling, studio color tokens (5 agent
  work colors, ink for deliverables, red reserved for errors), and a
  two-voice typography system (Bricolage Grotesque for UI chrome, Fraunces
  for document surfaces).
- **Web UI: artifact-first review surfaces** — chat tool activity as a
  compact agent work ledger; brief as a reviewable contract document with
  approval state; outline as single-column narrative slides (number rail,
  slim skeleton cards, enriched slide faces with an evidence/visual/notes
  spec sheet); art direction as per-slide style cards sharing the same rail
  grammar, with template and style sections on one alignment axis.
- Outline workflow now asks for `##` section headings when a deck has
  distinct parts, so review surfaces can render the story arc as chapters.

### Changed

- Style cover extraction is unified client-side: both `/styles` APIs
  (cloud and local) now serve raw style HTML (`html` field replaces
  `coverHtml`), and the style gallery opens previews with zero additional
  round-trips.
- Style previews and thumbnails keep the style author's own canvas
  background instead of forcing transparency.

### Fixed

- Style thumbnails rendered the first slide at 70% (standalone-viewing
  `body zoom` was not reset in the cloud cover path), leaving gutters
  around the cover; slides now fill thumbnails edge-to-edge.
- Unpainted regions of style slides (rounded corners, frame decorations)
  showed as opaque white inside the dark UI.
- One deck slide always fits the viewport in the full-size carousel view.
- Prose art direction (`art-direction.md`, no style selected) rendered as
  raw markdown inside an iframe; it is now typeset as a document.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-02

### Breaking

- **Stateless attachment pipeline** — `upload_file`, `read_uploaded_file`, and
  public MCP `pptx_to_json` tools are removed. Use `read_attachment(source)`
  and `import_attachment(source, deck_id)` instead. The new tools are stateless
  (no session storage, no uploadId) and accept local paths, S3 keys, or URLs
  directly.
- **`measure_slides` standalone tool removed** — measurement is now triggered
  exclusively via `run_python(measure_slides=[...])`.
- **`list_asset_sources` tool removed** — call `search_assets(query="")` for
  the same discovery listing (sources with counts).
- **`run_python` / `run_style_python` `save` parameter removed** — writes
  always persist; the deprecated flag is no longer accepted.
- **`run_python` `files` parameter removed** — use `read_attachment` to access
  uploaded file content, then reference by path in code.
- **Session restart required** — after `git pull`, restart all Local Web UI /
  ACP sessions. The next spawn will pick up the updated agent definitions
  (`agents-sync.ts` re-derives from `acp-agents/`). `make install-kiro` is
  only needed for global MCP config cleanup, not for allowlist updates.

### Changed

- `search_assets` now supports discovery mode: calling with an empty query
  (`query=""`) returns all asset sources with counts, replacing the removed
  `list_asset_sources` tool.
- `diff_pptx` now accepts committed import bundle directories as input,
  enabling the hand-edit sync workflow without the public `pptx_to_json` tool.
- Cloud file attachments use `POST /attachments/presign` + direct S3 PUT;
  Local Web UI uses `POST /api/attachments`. The `[Attached:...]` marker
  format is now `[Attached:{"v":1,"name":"...","source":"..."}]`.

### Fixed

- Cloud and local ACP deck agents now expose `arch_diagram`, as required by the
  composition workflow, so architecture, system, and flow diagrams use automatic
  routing and crossing minimization instead of silently falling back to manual
  placement.
- Attachment presigned PUTs now use Signature Version 4 — S3 rejects the
  conditional write (`If-None-Match`) with legacy SigV2 URLs, which broke all
  browser uploads in some regions (e.g. ap-northeast-1).
- The Web UI no longer sends a message when an attachment upload fails: input
  and attachments are kept for retry and the actual error (e.g. quota
  exceeded) is shown instead of a generic failure.
- Per-user raw attachment caps recalibrated for internal/team deployments
  (1000 objects / 50GB, overridable via `ATTACHMENT_MAX_OBJECTS` /
  `ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES`), and S3 lifecycle rules are prefix-only so
  attachment objects from pre-0.6 releases (which carry no `sdpm-class` tag)
  also expire. Deployments upgrading from the old upload pipeline should
  purge leftover `uploads/` objects — they otherwise count toward the quota.
- `servers/remote/constraints.txt` regenerated via `make lock`;
  `cachetools` / `protobuf` are pinned by `aws-opentelemetry-distro` and are
  now excluded from Dependabot bumps until the distro itself is upgraded.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **Kiro CLI: composer sub-agents are now self-spawned** — `make install-kiro`
  no longer generates `~/.kiro/agents/sdpm-composer.json`; the orchestrating
  agent spawns composer workers itself and pulls the composer behavior through
  `start_presentation(mode="composer")`. Upgrading from v0.5.2 or earlier,
  re-run `make install-kiro` once: it removes the legacy generated agent file
  (only if unmodified; a customized file is left in place with a warning).
- `start_presentation` now accepts `mode="single"` (one agent handles dialogue
  and composition end-to-end), making every persona reachable through the port.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **`run_python` persistence semantics unified**: file writes now always
  persist — the `save` flag is deprecated and ignored (silent data loss when
  omitting `save=True` on Cloud is no longer possible). The deck's PPTX
  artifact refreshes automatically whenever the deck changes;
  `measure_slides` remains the trigger for the expensive verification pass
  (render, text overflow measurement, previews). Cloud sandbox write-back is
  now diff-based (changed/new files only), preventing a stale sandbox copy
  from overwriting newer S3 writes

### Fixed

- Cloud: superseded PPTX artifacts are now deleted after each refresh — the
  automatic artifact refresh no longer accumulates orphaned objects in S3
  (`update_deck` returns previous values via `UPDATED_OLD`)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `make doctor` — diagnoses local setup (uv / LibreOffice / poppler, checkout
  path anchors) with a moved-checkout hint
- `make smoke` — boots the local MCP server over real stdio and verifies
  template/persona resolution (also runs in CI)
- GitHub Releases are now created automatically on tag push (notes extracted
  from this changelog)

### Fixed

- **Cloud agent output-token limit**: model profiles now set an explicit
  `max_tokens` (Claude 32768, others 8192) — Bedrock's small default truncated
  long single-call outputs (e.g. writing `specs/brief.md` from a long article)
  and killed the turn with a generic error. `MaxTokensReachedException` is also
  classified now (`max_output`) so the Web UI shows an actionable message
  instead of "something went wrong".

### Changed

- **L4 agent personas unified**: the cloud agent (Strands) now fetches mode
  behavior from `personas/*.md` through the same `start_presentation(mode=...)`
  port as every other client, instead of carrying its own copies in
  `agent/prompts/role/`. Duplicated role/workflow prompt files were removed;
  only transport-specific wiring (attachment wire format, `compose_slides`
  report format) remains in `agent/prompts/`. Prompt changes now touch only
  `personas/` for all layers.
- **Internal API move**: `sdpm.engine.diff.diff_report` / `load_slides_json_or_pptx`
  moved to `sdpm.api` (dependency-rule fix; `engine.diff` now exposes the pure
  `diff_slides(base, edit)`). These were internal APIs — update imports if you
  consumed them directly.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-31

Breaking architecture cleanup. No changes to the slide JSON schema — existing
decks and cloud data keep working. See the
[migration guide](docs/en/migration-v0.5.md) for upgrade steps.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Directory layout**: `skill/` → `sdpm/`, `mcp-local/` → `servers/local/`,
  `mcp-server/` → `servers/remote/`, `agents/` → `clients/claude-code/agents/`
- **Engine split**: the `sdpm` package is now organised as two peer subpackages —
  `sdpm.engine` (json ↔ pptx) and `sdpm.knowledge` (references / assets)
- **Skill files removed**: mode behavior now lives in `personas/*.md` and is
  served to any MCP client via the new `start_presentation(mode=...)` tool.
  Claude Code plugin no longer installs skills; Kiro installer no longer
  symlinks skill directories
- **Single tool contract**: every MCP tool is defined once in `sdpm.tools`;
  both servers bind the same functions (local: 24 tools, remote: 22 tools)
- **Docs**: English docs are canonical; Japanese docs reduced to README and
  getting-started

### Added

- `start_presentation(mode=...)` MCP tool — serves vibe / spec / style /
  composer / single personas to any MCP client
- `SDPM_SKILL_ROOT` environment override for path anchors (used by the remote
  Docker image, gateway integrations)
- Migration guide: `docs/en/migration-v0.5.md`

### Fixed

- Pinned `mcp>=1.28.1,<2` across local server, remote server, and agent —
  mcp 2.0.0 removed `mcp.server.fastmcp` and crashed fresh container builds
